        <b>Visual Studio Code,</b> also commonly referred to as <b>VS Code,</b> is
        a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, macOS and

        Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for
        development operations like debugging, task running, and version control.
        It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick
        code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller
        featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE

    <h3>Extensions in VS code</h3>
    <h4>1. Live Server:</h5>
    <p ALIGN="justify">
            Normally, when you make a change in your code or write something new, you
            need to refresh the page manually to see the changes. In other words, if
            you make 100 changes in your code each day, you need to refresh the
            browser 100 times. The live-server extension, however, automates this for
            you. After installing it, an automated localhost will be able to run in
            your browser, which you can start with a single button. Once you make
            changes in your code or write something new, after saving it, the browser
            will auto-refresh itself. Then you will be able to see the changes quickly
            and automatically.
    </p>
    <h4>2. Live Preview:</h4>
    <p ALIGN="justify">Previewing Code allows you to view a live-reloading browser preview inside the VS Code
            itself. You can use the preview feature to see the changes on a browser as soon as we make the changes in
            the code. We will need to install the Live Preview extension to use this feature. The Live Preview extension
            supports JavaScript, HTML, and CSS languages</p>
    <h4>3. Prettier:</h4> 
    <p ALIGN="justify">Prettier is a code formatter that formats javascript, typescript, html and many other formats. It reduces the need to manually format code. For instance, breaking up long lines, setting indentation, indentation levels and so forth. It ensure consistent formatting and style in your project, especially if there's multiple developers and make code easier to read</p>   
    <h4>4. Material Icon Theme:</h4>
    <p ALIGN="justify">It is a batch file which adds the material icons to the folders. This the most epic file icon theme for Visual Studio Code for an immersive experience.</p>
