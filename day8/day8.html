        <b>Chess :</b>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">Chess</a> is a board game
        for two players. It is sometimes called international chess or Western
        chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi (Chinese
        chess) and shogi (Japanese chess). Chess is an abstract strategy game
        that involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. It is
        played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid. The
        players, referred to as "White" and "Black", each control sixteen
        pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and
        eight pawns. White moves first, followed by Black. The game is won by
        checkmating the opponent's king, i.e. threatening it with inescapable
        capture. There are several ways a game can end in a draw.<br />

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger_hunt"
          >scavenger hunt</a
        >
        is a game in which the organizers prepare a list defining specific
        items, which the participants seek to gather or complete all items on
        the list, usually without purchasing them. Usually participants work in
        small teams, although the rules may allow individuals to participate.
        The goal is to be the first to complete the list or to complete the most
        items on that list. In variations of the game, players take photographs
        of listed items or be challenged to complete the tasks on the list in
        the most creative manner. A treasure hunt is another name for the game,
        but it may involve following a series of clues to find objects or a
        single prize in a particular order.<br />

        <b>Chardes :</b> Charades is a parlor or party word guessing game.
        Originally, the game was a dramatic form of literary charades: a single
        person would act out each syllable of a word or phrase in order,
        followed by the whole phrase together, while the rest of the group
        guessed. A variant was to have teams who acted scenes out together while
        the others guessed. Today, it is common to require the actors to mime
        their hints without using any spoken words, which requires some
        conventional gestures. Puns and visual puns were and remain common.

      Sports or athletic games typically performed in the open, including
      physical exertion, are referred to as outdoor games. All across the world,
      people enjoy playing outdoor games and sports since they are fun and
      beneficial for physical fitness. But these outdoor games for kids no

        numbers of players, apparel, and playing surface, they share broad
        characteristics of two opposing teams using a stick to propel a ball or
        disk into a goal. There are many types of hockey i.e. field hockey, ice

        Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of
        the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with
        two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor
        activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a
        rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock
        with the racquet and landing it within the other team's half of the
        court.<br />

        <b>Basketball :</b>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">Basketball</a> is a
        team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each,
        opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary
        objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in
        diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in
        diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of
        the court), while preventing the opposing team from shooting through
        their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from
        behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed
        play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul
        is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most
        points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with
        the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.<br />

        offence, referred to as a "raider", to run into the opposing team's half
        of the court, touch out as many of their players as possible, and return
        to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the
        defenders in 30 seconds. Points are scored for each player tagged by the
        raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider.
        Players are taken out of the game if they are touched or tackled, but
        return to the game after each point scored by their team from a tag or
        tackle.<br />
