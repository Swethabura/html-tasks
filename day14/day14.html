        <p align="justify">
          <big>1932</big> | A Giant of Industry <br />
          JRD Tata launched civil aviation in India in 1932, at a time when
          flying was a rich man's sport. What started as Tata Aviation Services,
          a department of Tata Sons, evolved into Tata Air Services, Tata Air
          Lines (1938) and then Air-India (1946).
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          <big>1938</big> | A Giant of Industry <br />
          At 34 years of age, JRD Tata was the youngest ever Chairman of the
          Tata group. He would go on to devote over 50 years to leading and
          shaping the future of the group.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          <big>1939</big> | A Giant of Industry <br />
          Under JRD’s Chairmanship, the Tata group took over Okha Salt Works,
          developing its own technology to manufacture soda ash — an especially
          challenging feat during WW II. The company went on to produce Tata
          Salt, and is the third largest soda ash producer globally.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">

          The National Radio and Electronics Co Ltd (NELCO) was floated to
          undertake the manufacture of radio transmitters and receivers. Today,
          with an installed base of 50,000+ VSATs on its network, Nelco has a
          pan-India network, and the largest antenna on the subcontinent.

        <h4>Heritage stories:</h4>
        <h4>1. The Openers</h4>
        <p align="justify">
          The Tata Group’s association with cricket has been a long and fruitful
          one dating back to our Founder Jamsetji Tata. It was his belief in
          sports as a force for good that seeded the Tata culture of supporting
          different games and the athletes who excelled in them.
        </p>
        <h4>2. "Tata Doesn't Always Mean Goodbye" - Part 1</h4>
        <p align="justify">
          Once, when JRD Tata was questioned about the most satisfying
          experience of his life, he instantly replied, “The flying experience
          has dominated. No other can equal the excitement of the first solo
          flight.”
        </p>
        <h4>3. Heritage The Man Who Helped The Mahatma</h4>
        <p align="justify">
          “ That India has been roused is evident from the generous gift of Mr
          Ratanji Jamshetji Tata. By his big donation of Rs. 25,000, he has
          given a powerful impetus to our movement,” Mahatma Gandhi wrote in the
          Indian Opinion in 1909.
        </p>
        <h4>4. JRD Tata and Leadership</h4>
        <p align="justify">
          It was Jamsetji who gave the House of Tatas its unique position in the
          nation. Jamsetji’s conduct shows that in his later years he did not
          ask ‘What enterprise is the most profitable?’ but, ‘What does the
          nation need?’ If the answer was steel, hydro-electric energy or a
          University of Science, Jamsetji would make best efforts to fulfil that
          need.

          Aalingana outlines the Tata approach to planet resilience, the group's
          aspiration of net zero by 2045 and the vision of securing the future
          by innovating today. It commits to embedding sustainability into
          business strategy by focusing on three interconnected pillars: driving
          the decarbonisation of our businesses and value chain; applying a
          systemic, circular economy approach to reduce resource use and waste;
          and preserving and restoring the natural environment. It also stays
          true to the social and environmental responsibility embedded in the
          group by the Founder himself.

            <b>The Power of Zero: </b>As the legend goes, Jamsetji Tata was on a
            picnic along a river in the Western Ghats when the idea struck him.
            ‘This water must be harnessed to generate power,’ the founder of the
            Tata group is known to have said. He then worked on a proposal that
            suggested three artificial lakes be created in these ghats near
            Mumbai and the power of flowing water be harnessed to generate clean
            electricity.

            is to reduce the use of natural resources and create a positive

            a resort that seamlessly blends luxury with sustainability. The Taj
