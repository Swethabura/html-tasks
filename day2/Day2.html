        <h3>Introducing Restaurant Services Hub: A one-stop shop for all your restaurant needs</h3>
        <p ALIGN="justify">Setting up and running a restaurant often comes with its own share of complexities, right from figuring out
                the ideal location and finding the ideal suppliers to getting requisite licenses and hiring the right
                staff.</p>

        <p ALIGN="justify">Many restaurants use vendors in order to streamline their operations, especially for specialized services
                like licensing and hiring. This, however, presents an additional challenge. Finding out the right
                agencies, negotiating for good pricing and ensuring good quality of service is a herculean task for
                them. This is tougher for small to medium sized restaurants with limited resources, experience, and
                access to be able to solve for these challenges.</p>

        <p ALIGN="justify">Keeping these challenges in mind, Zomato has introduced the Restaurant Services Hub, a one-stop solution to
                help all restaurants scale from zero to hundred. Utilizing a wide variety of vendors, Restaurant
                Services Hub has already serviced 3200+ restaurants over the last six months! We are now thrilled to
                extend these services to all restaurants across India, irrespective of their arrangement with Zomato.

        <h3>Diversity Dialogue II – Building an Inclusive Fleet: Insights from Zomato’s Equitable Action for Livelihood
        </h3>
        <p ALIGN="justify">At Zomato, we’re committed to building an inclusive world by sharing our learnings from our own experiences
                with creating a diverse workforce in our company and value chain. In our previous diversity dialogue, we
                talked about the business benefits of having women in warehouses and dark stores. This one is dedicated
                to our learnings from an 18 month long journey of onboarding over 400 Persons with Disabilities onto
                Zomato’s platform as delivery partners.</p>
        <h4>Delivering food and livelihoods: The role of gig work in empowering PwDs</h4>
        <p ALIGN="justify">India has over 26.8 million1 people living with disabilities, 31%2 of whom reside in urban cities. Despite
                supportive laws and policies, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is at a shocking 64%.
                Thus, dignified employment and livelihood opportunities remains a key challenge for persons with
                disabilities in India.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">Platforms like Zomato offer flexible earning opportunities with minimal barriers to entry. At present, anyone
                with a PAN card, knowledge of using a smartphone and riding a two wheeler can undertake deliveries and
                onboard themselves with Zomato as a delivery partner.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">In December 2022, Project ZEAL was launched (Zomato’s Equitable Action for Livelihood) to explore if
                gig-based delivery work could offer livelihood opportunities for Persons with Disabilities. As on 31
                March 2024, 400+ persons with locomotor disabilities, mostly wheelchair users, were onboarded on Zomato
                as delivery partners. These delivery partners have completed more than 6 lakh food delivery orders
                traveling over 15 lakh kms in 50 cities of India such as New Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad,
                Amritsar, Bhopal, Jaipur, Chandigarh, Agra and Lucknow.</p>
        <h4>Making the impossible possible: Through technology, commitment and sheer self-belief</h3>
                <p ALIGN="justify">Project ZEAL was conceived in collaboration with Neomotion Assistive Solutions Private Limited, an
                        IIT Madras incubated start-up that creates life transformative products for persons with
                        locomotor disabilities and the elderly. They provide personalized wheelchairs ‘NeoFly’ as well
                        as a motor-powered clip-on ‘NeoBolt’ which converts the NeoFly into a safe driving vehicle.

                        While Neomotion’s vehicles solved for the issue of mobility, Zomato also worked to reduce other
                        barriers to entry including waiving onboarding fees, establishing a system to register
                        wheelchairs separately and assigning wheelchair users only short-distance food order deliveries.
                </p>
                <p ALIGN="justify">In addition, for every food order assigned to a wheelchair user, customers and restaurant partners
                        are notified via the app that their delivery partner has special needs and are encouraged to
                        lend a helping hand in handing over/ collecting their order from the delivery partner.</p>

                <h3>Unlocking Innovation: Zomato’s journey to seamless iOS code sharing & distribution with Swift
                        Package Manager</h3>
                <h4>History of Zomato’s iOS apps</h4>
                <p ALIGN="justify">Most of you are probably familiar with the Zomato consumer app – the one you use to order food,
                        explore restaurants, dine out etc. But what you might not know is that we have a lot more apps
                        which fall under Zomato’s universe of iOS apps such as Blinkit, HyperPure, Zomato Restaurant
                        Partner, Zomato Dining Partner etc. Initially it was easy to replicate things, over time it
                        became evident that creating every app from scratch was inefficient and hard to manage
                        especially when fundamental layers of an app were already in place. This is why all these apps
                        share some part of the code originally written for the Zomato consumer app.</p>
                <p ALIGN="justify">Due to this need of code sharing, we structured our consumer code into various “Kits” for each use
                        case. For example, ZUIKit has the code required to use our UI components. All the sister apps
                        would take a copy of the relevant kits, customise them to their requirements and ship their app.
                        However, this approach resulted in teams using their own modified versions of the kits without a
                        centralised syncing system. In other words, the ZUIKit used by the Blinkit app was different
                        from the one used in the Zomato consumer app.</p>
                <p ALIGN="justify">Initially, this worked but whenever we needed the same behaviour across apps, we ended up manually
                        copying and pasting the specific files then testing them in every app. This was highly
                        inefficient and the issue compounded over time, as we found ourselves solving similar problems
                        across multiple teams.</p>
