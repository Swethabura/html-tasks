    <p ALIGN="justify">Java gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a very popular programming
        language since
        then. Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub" title="GitHub" target="_blank">GitHub.</a> Although still
        widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with <a
